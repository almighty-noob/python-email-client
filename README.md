# python-reports-automation
A small personal project that aims to make a daily task easier.

What does it do?
It reads from the excel file which stores my Daily Reports Data along with names of the .docx files to be attached in the report. Then, uses that data to write the Mail.
Then, an extremely basic tkinter window that sends the mail by taking the password and self-destrcuts when the mail is sent.
